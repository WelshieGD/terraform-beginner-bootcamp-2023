## Semantic Versioning

This project is going to use semantic versioning for its tagging.

Link - [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format will be (do not include a v in front of  the version numbers):

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
